\chapter{Geny Cryptocurrency (Token)}
\begin{quote}
We didn’t create a cryptocurrency... we created a gene! This is more than a token; it’s the DNA of interaction and creation in \texttt{Web3}.
\end{quote}
The GENY token, officially named \texttt{Genyleap}, is Genyleap’s digital currency, transforming our ecosystem into a dynamic, decentralized network. GENY is a “digital gene,” enabling individuals to create their identity and impact in \texttt{Web3}.
\begin{quote}
In every bit, a gene... in every gene, a world!
\end{quote}

\section*{Official Pronunciation}
In English, \textbf{GENY} is pronounced as \textit{``Jenny''} ({\ipafont /ˈdʒe.ni/}). The name derives from the fusion of “gene” and “why,” posing a conceptual question about the origin of creativity in the genetic structure of the digital world.

\section*{Technical Specifications of GENY}

\newpage

\section*{GENY Units and Subunits}
At Genyleap, we believe true value lies in the smallest units, not in billions of ineffective tokens. Our ecosystem is built on international unit standards (\texttt{SI}) and a binary system (powers of 2), ensuring precision and transparency at all levels. This intelligent structure, especially in reward systems and microtransactions, delivers a simple, accurate, and unique experience, where every interaction, like a singular gene, carries value, meaning, and creation.
\begin{quote}
Every interaction, a unique gene! GENY brings an unparalleled sense of creation and value.
\end{quote}
GENY is the primary unit of value, using binary prefixes like kibi (\texttt{Ki}) and mebi (\texttt{Mi}) to maintain computational precision across all scales. This system provides a robust foundation for interactions, from microtransactions to large-scale projects—transparent, engineered, and forward-looking.

\subsection*{GENY Units Table}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{GENY Subunits}
\small
\begin{tabular}{l c c r}
\hline
\textbf{Prefix} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Amount in GENY} & \textbf{Amount in \texttt{sub unit}} \\
\hline
Mebi (\texttt{MebiGENY}) & \texttt{MiGENY} & 1,048,576 & 268,435,456 \\
Kibi (\texttt{KibiGENY}) & \texttt{KiGENY} & 1,024 & 262,144 \\
-- & \texttt{GENY} & 1 & 256 \\
Milli (\texttt{MilliGENY}) & \texttt{mGENY} & 0.001 & 0.000256 \\
Micro (\texttt{MicroGENY}) & \texttt{\textmu GENY} & 0.000001 & 0.000000256 \\
Nano (\texttt{NanoGENY}) & \texttt{nGENY} & 0.000000001 & 0.000000000256 \\
Pico (\texttt{PicoGENY}) & \texttt{pGENY} & 0.000000000001 & 0.000000000000256 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Power-of-Two Scaling}
We use binary conversions (powers of 2, e.g., 1,024 instead of 1,000) to ensure digital computation accuracy. For example, 1 \texttt{KiGENY} equals 1,024 GENY, not 1,000 GENY. This standard, common in computer science for memory, processing, and data transfer, prevents rounding errors in microtransactions (e.g., \texttt{IoT} sensors or data analytics). This precision makes GENY ideal for advanced applications.

\subsection*{Applications of GENY and GEN}
Instead of billions of tokens, we use milli, micro, and nano units for small interactions and kibi and mebi for large projects. This approach enhances simplicity and appeal in the Genyleap ecosystem, particularly in tipping systems that create delightful and meaningful experiences.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Microtransactions}: \texttt{IoT} sensors transmit environmental data with 0.000000001 GENY.
    \item \textbf{Social Tipping}: 0.1 GENY to support a creative post.
    \item \textbf{Subscriptions}: Activate a premium subscription with 10 GENY.
    \item \textbf{Major Contributions}: Allocate 2,000,000 GENY via \texttt{DAO} for community projects.
\end{itemize}
